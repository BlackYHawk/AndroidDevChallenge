It reigns as one of the oldest dog breeds whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.

                  Novice pet parents, beware. Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space. They are not well-suited to apartment life, and they are certainly high-shedding pooches who need plenty of grooming to keep their coats healthy. Expect to clean up dog hair all year long, and especially during shedding season.

                  Alaskan Malamutes are high-energy dogs, and therefore require vigorous exercise. If you plan to leave them home while you’re at work, you may see some anxious, destructive behavior. A dog walker or pet sitter during the day is practically a must if you can’t be home, yourself.

                  An Alaskan Malamute will do well with an experienced pet parent, lots of open space to roam and burn off energy, and a cooler climate. If you can meet this breed’s needs, you’ll have an intelligent, highly-trainable, loving companion for life.",
